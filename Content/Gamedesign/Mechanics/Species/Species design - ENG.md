# General Principles
Here is a concrete description of what we are trying to achieve by creating different races for CrystallPunk 14, and the rules to follow when designing and introducing them into the game. It's a principle of concepts, not strict rules, you should keep that in mind.

### Balance
The races should be balanced between each other, **there should be no best option** that will be prioritized by players by meta, because everyone knows it is more powerful or more useful.

Try **not to create too many pluses and minuses for one race**, this can make races too strong in one area and helpless in another. A rough rule of thumb is 2-4 perks and disadvantages, depending on their impact on gameplay. 

**A bonus that can create interesting social interactions with other players is a good idea.

### Gameplay uniqueness
The final gameplay for a race must be unique enough to **define how the player interacts with other players, and how other players interact with the player**. 

This includes antagonists: Antagonists playing as a race should consider their characteristics and flaws when defining their gameplay. And if a race becomes the target of an antagonist, he must take its characteristics into account to eliminate or otherwise interact with it.

> You are a human mercenary with a target on plasmoid, jelly-like creatures. If you're going to sedate and bind it like you did with human targets, that would be a strange solution, most likely your victim will just get out of these shackles. And poisoning him is a bad idea, but cooling him or putting him in a container or a bag would make more sense.

And remember, each race should be unique, do not do just a silly reskin, or copy the race with minimal changes. Even races adapted to the same conditions can have a different impact on the game and have different features and contribution to the gameplay.

## Situationality of bonuses, rules for their design
When you design your race bonuses, you should also follow the following rules:

**Race bonuses should have multiple uses.** If your race feature can only be used for 1 purpose at a time, it is a bad feature.

> For example, with the same hover disk, you can quickly carry casualties on expeditions, or carry massively large loads of cargo. You can also roll a bard all over the tavern, or hook a hook to a tree and wrap the disk around it. Yes the ability solves one purpose - carrying objects from point A to point B, but it is not limited to **only that**.

**Bonuses should not be useful all the time.** If a race feature is always on (+10% to running speed) it is a bad bonus. If a race bonus manifests in a narrow situation that reflects the race trait (+10% running speed while drinking beer) it's a good bonus.

## Situationality of disadvantages, rules of their design
When designing the downsides of your races, you should also follow the following rules:

Like perks, **Disadvantages should be situational**, and should not affect gameplay permanently. In other words, as with the bonus example, a disadvantage should only manifest itself in a certain situation.

They **should not require anything from the player**. Dependence on items, services, or substances to gain access to basic actions available to other races is a bad tone. You shouldn't make a race that needs a beer every 10 minutes or they start taking damage.
