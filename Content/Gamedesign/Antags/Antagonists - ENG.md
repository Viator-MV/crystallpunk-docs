# Antagonist Design
Antagonists are one of the fundamental pillars of Spacestation 14, serving as a way to introduce chaos into the round. Historically, the implementation of various antags has been very successful or unsuccessful, ranging from extremely successful (space wizard) to controversial and unloved (revolutionaries).

The purpose of this document is to outline the basic principles of creating antagonists that players enjoy playing as, and to categorize the possible types of antagonists.

This document is not a strict list of requirements, but is meant to serve as a framework for how antagonists should feel and how to play. In some cases, a particular antag may deviate from the principles outlined in this document, and that is fine as long as the design still works and provides quality gameplay.

This document focuses on the concept of high-level antagonists and how to categorize them. Other documents will focus on specific goals/guidelines for creating a particular type of antagonist.

# Fundamentals of design

These are the basic principles of antagonist design. The design of all antagonists should follow these principles as closely as possible.

## A spark that leads to fire

Antagonists alone cannot gain the upper hand in a round. Their interaction with the team must turn their spark into a raging inferno of chaos or extinguish it into smoldering embers.

## Force Escalation

Antags' powers and capabilities evolve over the course of the round to their full potential. Antagonists should not be able to use their abilities to their full potential at the start of the round.

## No Cooperation

Antagonists should not be encouraged to be able to help as part of a team and be friendly to them. Friendly antagonists mean no interesting conflict in the round, and therefore no development of the round.

## Step forward, step back

Success or failure should not depend on a single event, rather there should be small wins and losses throughout the round that add up to a final climax.

## Discoverability

There should be clear “breadcrumbs” that make it clear which antagonists are present. The crew must also be aware of their counterplay options to prevent antagonists from rapidly escalating.
  
## Accessibility

Antags should be given all the information they need to fulfill their role and what they are allowed and not allowed to do to accomplish their goals. 
  
## Losing is fun

Losing/death by antag should not be perceived as an injustice by the player. Players should always have a choice in terms of counterplay. The same goes for antags: they should always feel that they have options and are not difficult to counter.
(Hypo-handedness is a bad example)

# Antagonist categories

These are the categories that an antagonist should fall into. The categories determine how many players play for a particular antagonist and their relationship to the objectives. Antagonists must belong to only one category.

## Single Antagonist.

Solitary in nature. Either only one member of this type is present, or each acts independently, pursuing their own goals. Lone antagonists may team up if their goals are the same.

## Team Antagonist

A group of antagonists with a common goal. Team antags are significantly more powerful (and therefore rarer) than single antags. This group usually has a fixed set of members who are known to each other. Group antags can work with single/other group antags if their goals are the same.

## Conversion Antagonist

A small group or single antagonist that is weak at first but has high snowball potential. They may have a hierarchical structure with the original group serving as the “leader”. Converts the team to like-minded antagonists or resources that can be used for their own betterment. It is important that this type does not incentivize the team to voluntarily become antagonists, making the situation worse in the round, or have some form of mechanics to prevent snowballing.

# Antagonist categories

These serve as a guide to how much impact an antag should have on a particular round or station with their abilities/items. In addition, the categories also quantify how much impact the antags specific objectives have on the rest of the station. An antag can only belong to one category.

## Large

Can wreak havoc on an entire round very quickly using their powerful tools/abilities. These antags tend to become the main focus of the round if not engaged early on. Tend to work predominantly alone. Most main antag targets are exceptional, leading to conflict between other main antags if present.

## Minor.

Such antags do not require (and are mechanically limited to) major sabotage or multiple assassinations. Usually operate within short-term self-serving personal goals, utilizing their limited tools/abilities. May join major antagonists if their goals are aligned.

## Neutral

An antagonist with a self-serving goal that is not in direct conflict with the team. Neutral antagonists avoid direct conflict and escalation, prioritizing their own survival. They also have the freedom to join a team or antagonists, depending on which group best suits their purpose and chances of survival.

## Helpers

Usually the result of another antag's actions. The goals of the helping antagonist are the same as its creator/convert. May help other antag if it benefits their creator.

## Pests

May pose either a minor threat or no problem, external or internal to the station, usually cannot communicate with the crew in any significant way, and has very limited capabilities at its disposal with an extremely simple self-serving direct purpose.

# Examples from SS14

Here are some examples of how to use categories/worldviews when creating antagonists in Space Station 14. These descriptions are illustrative examples only and may not reflect the actual intentions of current or future antagonists.

## Nuclear Operatives: Large, Commanding.

Nukeers are a large, command antagonist whose goal is to reach and detonate the station's nuclear self-destruct warhead.

They are team antagonists because they start with a small, limited team of players, and they have no effective means of massively transforming the team. They have reinforcements and borg, but those are secondary mechanics and don't really qualify them as conversion antagonists.

They are the primary enemy because achieving their goal will result in the complete destruction of the station, and they have access to very powerful weapons and tools to accomplish their goals. They also have an incentive to engage in direct combat because their target is in one of the safest areas on the station, and their equipment is primarily combat-oriented.

The tendency for them to engage in direct combat, their highly recognizable equipment, and their circular aim very clearly place them in the category of major antags.

## Blob: Large, Conversion

The blob is the main antagonist of the conversion, whose goal is to self-replicate and take over the entire station.

They are a conversion-based antagonist because the blob's initial core is very weak and vulnerable, however as the blob expands throughout the station, it gains more power. The blobs can also transform crew members into zombie blobs to protect the core.

They are the main antagonists because their goal is to expand and completely take over the station and turn it into one giant blob organism. Their abilities are initially very weak, but they scale exponentially with time and the amount of space the blob occupies.

## Thief: Neutral, Solitary

The thief is a neutral, solitary antagonist whose goal is to steal objective items to satisfy his kleptomania.

The thief being a solitary antagonist speaks for itself.

The thief's goal is simply to steal his objects and not get caught. The goal itself doesn't conflict with the team's goals, but stealing certain items can cause chaos on the station. This clearly makes the thief a neutral antagonist, as he is not in direct conflict with the team.
