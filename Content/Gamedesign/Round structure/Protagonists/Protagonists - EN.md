# Protagonists

Every story should have protagonists. Protagonists who have objectives to accomplish, and are challenged to accomplish them.
In the case of a multiplayer game with dozens of players, the protagonists are all players at the same time, moving the story forward by the totality of all their actions. The rule of thumb that follows from this is:

***All key important mechanics/player abilities must be available in all situations***. Key refers to mechanics without which the game will not work. These include:
- Mechanics of the round's game cycle (arrival in round, end of round, late joining, early exit from round)

## Game Roles

Different players can take part in a story by assuming different game roles. 
A game role is a set of distinctive qualities, such as:
- **Starting Equipment**. Different roles have different equipment. This fulfills 2 purposes:
  - **Visual differentiation**. Players should be able to identify a player's role by their appearance
  - **Key Items**. Players should have an advantage in handling the key mechanics of the role, compared to other roles, with the help of starting equipment.
- ~~**Additional Skills**~~. *The skill system is still in question for now*.
- **Social Rights and Responsibilities**. The existing IC system of laws, rules, and responsibilities operating during the expedition determines the defined status of each individual role.
- **Personal Goals in the Round**. Each role must have personal goals established by the game, which sets the vector of the player's actions. 
- **Close connection to the key mechanics of the role**. Each role must have 1 key mechanic that it specializes in. Other roles can use it too, but it is that role that has bonuses, challenges, and enhanced abilities attached to it.

All of these qualities form the unique gameplay for each game role.

The game roles are divided into 3 categories. 
- **Mercenaries**.  The main labor force of the round, motivated by making money.
- **Organizers**. The most important figures in the round, having high authority and access. The main goal of organizers is to fulfill the goal of the round. But this goal can be achieved through social interaction and proper management of the mercenary workforce (and paying them money). 
- **Guards**. Essentially a subspecies of mercenaries whose primary purpose is to ensure the safety of the expedition members, the organizers, and their property.
- **Priests**. A separate cluster of roles that, depending on the chosen deity, can interchange the activities of the various mercenary roles. Unlike mercenaries, the main goal is not to make money, but to theologically capture the majority of players in the round.

The target number of players per round is 50. As SS14 experience shows, from 60 and above it becomes very difficult to control the chaos of players, and it does not contribute to the quality of the game.
Based on this figure, we can roughly categorize the number of players into three categories.

| Category | Number of players | Details |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Organizers | 5 | The smallest group, consisting of a few key individuals with radically different areas of responsibility. Approved - Guard Commander, Captain of the Expedition, Quartermaster.
| Guards | 10 
| Mercenaries | 26 |
| Priests | 3 + 3 + 3 | Divided into unrelated opposing threes |
